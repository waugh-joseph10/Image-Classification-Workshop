# Image Classification Workshop

This repo contains resources for a TensorFlow Image classification workshop I led in April 2023. This workshop will show how to build, train, and evaluate a basic image classification model in TensorFlow. 

By the end of the session, participants should be able to understand core logic of building an image dataset, processing images for training, image classification modelling via transfer learning, and image model evaluation. These learning outcomes will be achieved using the TensorFlow image classification library. 

## Environment Setup

In your Python environment, you can install required libraries for this work by calling the below code: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
